# NodeJS Events Based Framework

Idea of ​​an event-based framework.

I like the idea of ​​event-driven systems, which allow participants to be decoupled from a process, facilitating more agile collaboration.

What if we applied this idea to the way we normally program?

Instead of the main function doing the commands, it simply notifies the subscribed plugins to act accordingly. 

This could also be done in each plugin, successively.
